    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you roll a virtual dice.

Arbitrary randomness is now at your fingertips. Flip a coin, choose a direction, or roll a dice all the way up to a D100.

Note: Copying with the icon setting is currently broken. The text gets garbled in the clipboard. This has been fixed on github and should be in the next repentogon release. Logging to file works correctly. The log file is located here: C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Repentance\log.txt

Update: Basic support for Mod Config Menu has been added. If you don't have repentogon then you can use MCM instead.

Update x2: You can now roll the dice floor in a dice room that's off the grid. Just start a new run, and select the option in ImGui or MCM.

Update x3: On Rep+, you can now roll the online emotes in offline mode with: alt+1 (coin flip), alt+2 (direction), alt+3 (d6), alt+4 (d20)</description>
